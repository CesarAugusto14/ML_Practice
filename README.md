This repo is ffor studying Machine Learning by using Pytorch. I will be using classical and known sets for training my Networks. So far, I've been training:

- MNIST with PyTorch by using a CNN with Regularization + Early Stopping. 

For the next implementation, I will use a Colored Dataset for classification tasks. I pretend to use an Scheduler to change the Learning Rate.
